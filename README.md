The Self-Deployable Open Source LLM Q&A Assistant is a powerful and user-friendly question-answering system that works on your local files with persistent storage. It utilizes a Language Model like GPT-3.5 (GPT-3, Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries.

## Features

- Easy-to-use interface: Simple and intuitive user experience for asking questions and getting instant answers from your local files.
- Persistent storage: The assistant saves important information across sessions, allowing users to access previously asked questions and answers.
- Language Model: Utilizes a state-of-the-art Language Model (such as GPT-3.5) to achieve high-quality responses.
- Customizable: Developers can fine-tune the assistant according to specific use cases and requirements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kvmukilan/self-deployable-open-source-llm--qna-assistant-on-user-files-with-persistence.git

## Usage

1. Prepare your data: Place the files or documents you want the assistant to work with in a designated directory. Make sure the files are in a supported format (e.g., text files, PDFs, etc.).

2. Configure the assistant: Customize the settings and parameters of the Language Model, such as the context window, response length, and more, in the configuration file.

3. Run the assistant: Execute the main script to start the question-answering assistant:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Ask questions: Use the command-line interface to ask questions about the contents of your local files. The assistant will provide relevant and accurate answers based on the context.
